# Autonomous Systems Path/Route Planning

For our autonomous systems assignment, we were given the task of simulating a robot navigating a maze. From the given starting point (blue dot) the robot needs to visit all five randomly generated waypoints (red asterisks) as quickly as possible. Along the way, there are pre-planned obstacles that the robot initially doesn't know exists. Obstacles are instead avoided using the robot's onboard sensor.

My part of the project was to design the pathing system for the robot in reaction to the randomly generated waypoints but without considering the obstacles. Also included is an improved solution that I thought of after the assignment was completed.


## Getting Started

For those who want to compare, test, or vizualize the code use the files of compareHeuristicOptimized, compareSolutions, empiricalTesting, and visualizeOptimization.


### Compare the Heuristic and Optimized solution for a path

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system



Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Visualize the Optimization of a path

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
### Compare the Original and Improved solution for a set of waypoints

### Empirical test the average time taken
